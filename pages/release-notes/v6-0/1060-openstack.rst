Known Issues in 6.0
-------------------

Deploying new controllers causes services downtime
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When :ref:`adding controllers<add-controller-ops>`
to an existing environment,
nova-api is unavailable for a few minutes,
which causes services to be unavailable.
See `LP1370067 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370067>`_.

An instance may hang after live migration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An instance may hang with a kernel panic
after a live migration operation completes successfully.
The root cause is not yet known,
but is probably related to qemu-kvm/libvirt issues.
Using offline migration of instances is recommended
until this issue is resolved.
